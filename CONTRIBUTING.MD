# Contributing to EcoWeave

Thank you for considering contributing to **EcoWeave**! This project aims to build a decentralized **Mesh Network** using a **Tangle structure** for peer-to-peer information sharing without relying on external APIs.

Below, you will find guidelines on how to contribute, areas for improvement, and best practices to follow.

---

## üìå Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have **Rust** installed ([Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)).
- Clone the repository:
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ecoweave.git
  cd ecoweave
  ```
- Install dependencies:
  ```sh
  cargo build
  ```

### Running Tests
Before submitting changes, ensure all tests pass:
```sh
cargo test
```

## üî• Areas for Improvement
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Network Resilience**
- Implement **transaction redundancy** to prevent data loss when nodes go offline.
- Introduce a **node heartbeat system** to detect inactive nodes.
- Optimize node caching for better transaction retention.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Transaction Propagation**
- Replace `tokio::time::sleep` with an **efficient gossip protocol** to improve transaction diffusion.
- Implement **smart neighbor selection** for more efficient routing.
- Introduce **priority-based propagation** (favor newest or most approved transactions).

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Optimizing the Weighted Random Walk**
- Normalize transaction weights to ensure balanced selection.
- Introduce **exploratory randomness** to avoid path biases.
- Simulate different network conditions to test efficiency.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Security Enhancements**
- Implement a **Sybil attack protection mechanism** (e.g., reputation-based node scoring).
- Introduce a **lightweight Proof of Work (PoW)** to deter transaction spamming.
- Develop a **trust score system** based on node validation history.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Persistent Storage**
- Store transactions in **SQLite, RocksDB, or LMDB** instead of only using `HashMap`.
- Implement **Tangle state snapshots** to restore from failures.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Visualization & Debugging Tools**
- Develop a **real-time dashboard** to monitor transaction flow.
- Enhance logging with **structured logs** for debugging.
- Integrate **Graphviz** or similar tools to visualize the Tangle structure.

- Ensure all changes are **well-tested**.
- Write **clear commit messages**:
  ```sh
  git commit -m "[feature] Improved transaction propagation"
  ```

### **3. Push and Open a Pull Request**
```sh
  git push origin feature-your-feature
```
- Open a **Pull Request (PR)** with a detailed description.

### **4. Code Review Process**
- Your PR will be reviewed for **performance, security, and best practices**.
- Address any requested changes and push updates.
- Once approved, it will be merged into the main branch.
